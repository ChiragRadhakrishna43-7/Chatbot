<p align="justify">The PyQt6 library has been utilized to design the user-interface. The OpenAI library has been used to facilitate the interaction between the user and the bot. The OpenAI API key has been incorporated in the backend python file to facilitate the input of user request and generation of the corresponding response. The front-end application and the chatbot design has been implemented using OOP concepts. Extensive usage of classes and methods is evident in the source code.</p>

The two main libraries, PyQt6 and OpenAI can be installed using the following commands:
